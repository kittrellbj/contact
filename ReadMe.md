# Reflection Report and JUnit Test Examples
## Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance

> How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Testing software is critical to the software development lifecycle, ensuring project requirements, and securing software against vulnerabilities. Technical excellence plays a role in functional and secure software&emdash;to have knowledge of potential risks and issues&emdash;but even seasoned software engineers do not produce perfect code without testing. Everyone, beginning to master, needs to make sure.

Many methods exist to test code, and I have found a mixture of automated and manual testing leads to the best results for my code. Testing packages like JUnit (Java), NCover or MSTest (C#), and many others may be used for unit testing the code. Alongside the unit testing&emdash;and often before unit testing begins&emdash;I use manual testing on parts of the code as I go to provide inputs and observe outputs, which allows me to spot fix areas of concern.

> How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Two primary methods for requirement gathering involve outlining and user stories. An outline gives a broad overview of the general idea of what the software should accomplish or what need it serves, and this represents the "big picture" of the project. This outline need not drill down into fine detail, but a general idea of where the project should be going can be helpful, and establishing major categories of work can help determine dependencies in the project and order in which tasks should be completed for the highest efficiency.
